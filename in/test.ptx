[L_1 := x-2y+23=0]
[L_2 := 2x-y-3=0]

Working with L_1:
[x-2y+23=0]
[-2y=-x-23]
[y=(x+23)/2]

Working with L_2:
[2x-y-3=0]
[-y=-2x+3]
[y=2x-3]

Set them equal to each other
[2x-3=(x+23)/2]
[4x-6=x+23]
[3x-29=0]
[x=29/3]

Sub that in
[2x-y-3=0]
[2<29/3>-y-3=0]
[58/3=y+3]
[49/3=y]

[P=<29/3, 49/3>]
